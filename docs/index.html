              <p>My name is Aaron Cartierre Jackson and I am co-chaplain of the Birmingham Beavers. Looking back over my life, I can see where God was equipping me and preparing me for this opportunity. <br><br>Even though I grew up in the church, I viewed it as simply a tradition (religion). I grew up always confessing Christ with my lips, but my life continued to deny him.<br><br>It wasnt until I was in college and someone came to my dorm room to preach the gospel that it really made me think there was something more to Christianity. For this stranger, it wasn&rsquo;t just the tradition of church—it was real enough for him to share with others.<br><br>That conversation prompted me to pray a prayer similar to, &ldquo;God, if you&rsquo;re real I want to know you like that kid knows you!&rdquo;. I then opened up my KJV Bible and started to read it for the first time with out being prompted by anyone else and God opened up my heart to understand his beautiful pursuit of me! I surrendered everything! I gave my life fully to Christ.<br><br>From that new beginning, I knew a few things. First the power of evangelism and its importance. Second, that prayer works! <br><br>My dorm was the only dorm he stopped in that night - why? The only thing I could think of was growing up hearing my mom and grandma praying, &ldquo;as for me and my house we will serve the Lord&rdquo;. I believe it was God honoring those prayers that the kid felt lead to our door that night.<br><br>God has opened up my eyes, so I want to help open the eyes of others. I&rsquo;m a firm believer that every time the gospel is preached, it bears fruit.</p>

              <p>My name is Al Beahn and I am really excited to serve as a co-chaplain of the Westside Woolly Mammoths of the United Shore Professional Baseball League. As a former junior college and Division 1 baseball player, I understand how difficult it is to get to the next level in any sport. It is my hope to provide these players with love, support and encouragement on and off the field as they pursue their dream to play at the next level in the MLB. <br><br> Our role as chaplains is to provide players with spiritual guidance and growth in the word of God. Chapels allow us to present a message of hope in a team setting, but then once per week, we provide a league-wide bible study to any player interested.  The real spiritual growth comes from the one-on-one relationships that develop over time throughout the season. It is my goal to model the love of Christ to every player and coach with my words and actions,  to share the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ, and to disciple every player on a spiritual journey of their own. <br><br> Twelve years ago, I decided to live my life for something bigger than my own. Today I am willing to share my story, life experiences and spiritual journey with anyone willing to listen. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&rdquo;  These are words of hope, healing and new life. Salvation is available to everyone that believes in Jesus Christ. And for me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.</p>

              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/team/kyle.png" alt="">
              <p>My name is Kyle Murphy. I live and work in the Metro Detroit Area and have enjoyed many games at USPBL over the last couple of years. The 2019 season will be my first serving with Champion Sports Ministry as co-chaplain of the Eastside Diamond Hoppers. <br><br> To share a little about myself, I was blessed to be raised by parents who taught me about God from the time I was born and raised me in the church. As I became an adult, though, I chose the way of the prodigal son and squandered this blessing by choosing to live according to my own will rather than God’s will. He never gave up on me though, and when I turned back to Him I found Him waiting with open arms, eager to welcome me back. <br><br> Since rededicating my life to the Lord, I have had the opportunity to serve Him in many ways. One of the most rewarding has come over the last several years while serving as a volunteer chaplain with Message of Hope Jail and Prison Ministry. During my time serving in this capacity, the Holy Spirit has shown me how alike we all are. Regardless of our age, status, or demographics, we are all broken and in need of a Savior. God created each one of us as a unique and wonderful creation and loves us equally. He provides grace and forgiveness to all His children through Jesus Christ and He calls those of us who have accepted Jesus as our Lord and Savior to share that good news with others. <br><br> I’ve never been a gifted speaker, but I have found that when I answer God’s calling in my life and act on my faith in Him, He equips me. It is my hope and prayer that He will do just that in my encounters with these professional athletes and that His love and truth will be made evident to them. I look forward to seeing God move in amazing and unexpected ways in their lives in this upcoming season and for years to come!</p>

              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/team/marty.png" alt="">
              <p>My name is Marty Ream and I am a co-chaplain of the Utica Unicorns. I came to be a chaplain through a relationship that started 23 years ago. <br><br>I was raised in a traditional church. I believed that God was someone who was typically not interested in me unless I did wrong, and only listened when I needed him to do something. I lived my life as though I was in charge. I was a good person on the outside, but selfish and prideful on the inside. In a worldly view, I was successful in my job, had a new house, normal marriage, and a new daughter, but I soon realized that my life as I knew it was about to turn upside down. My wife left, family split, and I hit bottom. My world was not in my control.<br><br> During this time, I was invited to play softball for a “church team” by a couple of co-workers who could see that I needed direction. Through their persistence and love, I started playing on this team. I soon found myself being around a group of guys who shared a love for sports as well as their love for Jesus Christ. Through sports, I was now on a journey to know Jesus as well. It was their obedience to God that contributed to me making my own choice. I was “reborn” into a new life to follow Jesus. I soon became the Sports Ministry Leader of a large church. My story of becoming a fully-devoted follower through sports influenced me to offer that same avenue for those who do not know Jesus as their Savior. Looking back over the past 23 years, I can see where God was equipping me and preparing me for this new adventure as a baseball chaplain in the USPBL and to lead those who think God is irrelevant into fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.</p>

              <h2>Ray Ortega</h2>
              <p class="item-intro text-muted">Chaplain</p>
              
              <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="img/team/ray.jpg" alt="">
              <p>I accepted Jesus as Lord when I was 12 years old at a Third Day concert my parents took me to. I fell asleep that night with my eternity secured. The next morning I woke up and started a 7-year span walking hand in hand with the devil. I forgot about my decision to follow Christ as I began to let evil influences run my life. The devil tried hard and gave me many many things. I lost my virginity at 12 years old and was addicted to pornography shortly after. I have had a countless number of sexual encounters, and addiction to drugs followed. I lived lavishly, lustfully, effortlessly obtaining anything I thought I wanted. <br><br> I have no shame claiming the prodigal son story as my own - it is the truth. Throughout the story, I dreamed of playing in the MLB, but little by little my dreams began to crumble as I simultaneously began to learn the hunger for sin is never satisfied and only intensifies.  I was prideful and stubborn as I vowed to fix the things I had broke by my own power. Baseball was a vehicle that God used to allow me to travel through life. But as the vehicle began to break down, and my faith and dreams were shaken. <br><br> Eventually, the reality set in - I was not going to play in the MLB. This realization was the first true moment I reached complete emptiness. It was as if my identity and purpose were stripped away. The kid in me was orphaned. <br><br> That is when it happened. The whisper, which was always there, was louder than ever, and I remembered. I gave my heart to Jesus. God allowed me to fail like a good father sometimes needs to do. He broke me down  in order to build me back up the way he had always intended me to be. <br><br> It was hard for me to accept that my playing career was ending, but that is when I heard God speak to my heart. “You have eternity to play baseball my son, but I need you to do something for me first. I need you to recruit your brothers and sisters so that you and all of us have enough to field a team to play with. I need you to go out and recruit a whole league of players!” It all made sense. My purpose is to continue the work Jesus started of helping people become followers of Christ. The best part is that I have been given the same power he used while he lived out his story. <br><br> After I repented and began truly following through with the decision I made as a 12-year-old, so many doors have opened. I miraculously went from coaching independent baseball to coaching Triple-A for the San Francisco Giants overnight! As I give my platform to God for his usage, God has continued to grow the platform I get to use. My mission on earth is to spread His message, that there is salvation and reconciliation for everyone. We are all family and we need to put God back in the throne in our hearts. The reality is He is alive, Jesus is alive, and living separated from our real family is ignorant and foolish. We all have a seat at the table, and we need to acknowledge whose table it is.</p>
