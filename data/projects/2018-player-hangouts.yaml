description: Champion Sports Ministries chaplains sponsored an evening of bowling, fowling, cornhole, and more as a time to rest from the difficult pace and pressure of the life of professional athletics. These kinds of opportunities allow chaplains to better connect with athletes, and athletes to become better friends with one another. Spending quality time together helps faciliate trust and future spiritual conversations as a result.
