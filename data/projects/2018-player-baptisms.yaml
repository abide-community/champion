description: In September 2018, athletes from the teams in the United Shore Professional Baseball League, a semi-pro baseball league located in metro Detroit, were invited by their chaplains to be baptized and publicly declare their desire to follow Jesus. Players, friends, ad families gathered at Jimmy Johns Field in Utica, MI, where the USPBL hosts its games, for a baptism service unlike any other. Check out the photos to see the on-field baptisms as well as joy in the players who dedicated their lives to Christ.
