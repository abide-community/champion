description: My name is Kyle Murphy. I live and work in the Metro Detroit Area and have enjoyed many games at USPBL over the last couple of years. The 2019 season will be my first serving with Champion Sports Ministry as co-chaplain of the Eastside Diamond Hoppers. <br><br> To share a little about myself, I was blessed to be raised by parents who taught me about God from the time I was born and raised me in the church. As I became an adult, though, I chose the way of the prodigal son and squandered this blessing by choosing to live according to my own will rather than God’s will. He never gave up on me though, and when I turned back to Him I found Him waiting with open arms, eager to welcome me back. <br><br> Since rededicating my life to the Lord, I have had the opportunity to serve Him in many ways. One of the most rewarding has come over the last several years while serving as a volunteer chaplain with Message of Hope Jail and Prison Ministry. During my time serving in this capacity, the Holy Spirit has shown me how alike we all are. Regardless of our age, status, or demographics, we are all broken and in need of a Savior. God created each one of us as a unique and wonderful creation and loves us equally. He provides grace and forgiveness to all His children through Jesus Christ and He calls those of us who have accepted Jesus as our Lord and Savior to share that good news with others. <br><br> I’ve never been a gifted speaker, but I have found that when I answer God’s calling in my life and act on my faith in Him, He equips me. It is my hope and prayer that He will do just that in my encounters with these professional athletes and that His love and truth will be made evident to them. I look forward to seeing God move in amazing and unexpected ways in their lives in this upcoming season and for years to come!
