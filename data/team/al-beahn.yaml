description: My name is Al Beahn and I am really excited to serve as a co-chaplain of the Westside Woolly Mammoths of the United Shore Professional Baseball League. As a former junior college and Division 1 baseball player, I understand how difficult it is to get to the next level in any sport. It is my hope to provide these players with love, support and encouragement on and off the field as they pursue their dream to play at the next level in the MLB. <br><br> Our role as chaplains is to provide players with spiritual guidance and growth in the word of God. Chapels allow us to present a message of hope in a team setting, but then once per week, we provide a league-wide bible study to any player interested.  The real spiritual growth comes from the one-on-one relationships that develop over time throughout the season. It is my goal to model the love of Christ to every player and coach with my words and actions,  to share the good news of salvation through Jesus Christ, and to disciple every player on a spiritual journey of their own. <br><br> Twelve years ago, I decided to live my life for something bigger than my own. Today I am willing to share my story, life experiences and spiritual journey with anyone willing to listen. Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the life."  These are words of hope, healing and new life. Salvation is available to everyone that believes in Jesus Christ. And for me, to live is Christ and to die is gain.
