description: My name is Marty Ream and I am a co-chaplain of the Utica Unicorns. I came to be a chaplain through a relationship that started 23 years ago. <br><br>I was raised in a traditional church. I believed that God was someone who was typically not interested in me unless I did wrong, and only listened when I needed him to do something. I lived my life as though I was in charge. I was a good person on the outside, but selfish and prideful on the inside. In a worldly view, I was successful in my job, had a new house, normal marriage, and a new daughter, but I soon realized that my life as I knew it was about to turn upside down. My wife left, family split, and I hit bottom. My world was not in my control.<br><br> During this time, I was invited to play softball for a “church team” by a couple of co-workers who could see that I needed direction. Through their persistence and love, I started playing on this team. I soon found myself being around a group of guys who shared a love for sports as well as their love for Jesus Christ. Through sports, I was now on a journey to know Jesus as well. It was their obedience to God that contributed to me making my own choice. I was “reborn” into a new life to follow Jesus. I soon became the Sports Ministry Leader of a large church. My story of becoming a fully-devoted follower through sports influenced me to offer that same avenue for those who do not know Jesus as their Savior. Looking back over the past 23 years, I can see where God was equipping me and preparing me for this new adventure as a baseball chaplain in the USPBL and to lead those who think God is irrelevant into fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.
