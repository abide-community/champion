description: I accepted Jesus as Lord when I was 12 years old at a Third Day concert my parents took me to. I fell asleep that night with my eternity secured. The next morning I woke up and started a 7-year span walking hand in hand with the devil. I forgot about my decision to follow Christ as I began to let evil influences run my life. The devil tried hard and gave me many many things. I lost my virginity at 12 years old and was addicted to pornography shortly after. I have had a countless number of sexual encounters, and addiction to drugs followed. I lived lavishly, lustfully, effortlessly obtaining anything I thought I wanted. <br><br> I have no shame claiming the prodigal son story as my own - it is the truth. Throughout the story, I dreamed of playing in the MLB, but little by little my dreams began to crumble as I simultaneously began to learn the hunger for sin is never satisfied and only intensifies.  I was prideful and stubborn as I vowed to fix the things I had broke by my own power. Baseball was a vehicle that God used to allow me to travel through life. But as the vehicle began to break down, and my faith and dreams were shaken. <br><br> Eventually, the reality set in - I was not going to play in the MLB. This realization was the first true moment I reached complete emptiness. It was as if my identity and purpose were stripped away. The kid in me was orphaned. <br><br> That is when it happened. The whisper, which was always there, was louder than ever, and I remembered. I gave my heart to Jesus. God allowed me to fail like a good father sometimes needs to do. He broke me down  in order to build me back up the way he had always intended me to be. <br><br> It was hard for me to accept that my playing career was ending, but that is when I heard God speak to my heart. “You have eternity to play baseball my son, but I need you to do something for me first. I need you to recruit your brothers and sisters so that you and all of us have enough to field a team to play with. I need you to go out and recruit a whole league of players!” It all made sense. My purpose is to continue the work Jesus started of helping people become followers of Christ. The best part is that I have been given the same power he used while he lived out his story. <br><br> After I repented and began truly following through with the decision I made as a 12-year-old, so many doors have opened. I miraculously went from coaching independent baseball to coaching Triple-A for the San Francisco Giants overnight! As I give my platform to God for his usage, God has continued to grow the platform I get to use. My mission on earth is to spread His message, that there is salvation and reconciliation for everyone. We are all family and we need to put God back in the throne in our hearts. The reality is He is alive, Jesus is alive, and living separated from our real family is ignorant and foolish. We all have a seat at the table, and we need to acknowledge whose table it is.
