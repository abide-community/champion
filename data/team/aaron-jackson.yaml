description: My name is Aaron Cartierre Jackson and I am co-chaplain of the Birmingham Beavers. Looking back over my life, I can see where God was equipping me and preparing me for this opportunity. <br><br>Even though I grew up in the church, I viewed it as simply a tradition (religion). I grew up always confessing Christ with my lips, but my life continued to deny him.<br><br>It wasnt until I was in college and someone came to my dorm room to preach the gospel that it really made me think there was something more to Christianity. For this stranger, it wasn't just the tradition of churchâ€”it was real enough for him to share with others.<br><br>That conversation prompted me to pray a prayer similar to, "God, if you're real I want to know you like that kid knows you!". I then opened up my KJV Bible and started to read it for the first time with out being prompted by anyone else and God opened up my heart to understand his beautiful pursuit of me! I surrendered everything! I gave my life fully to Christ.<br><br>From that new beginning, I knew a few things. First the power of evangelism and its importance. Second, that prayer works! <br><br>My dorm was the only dorm he stopped in that night - why? The only thing I could think of was growing up hearing my mom and grandma praying, "as for me and my house we will serve the Lord". I believe it was God honoring those prayers that the kid felt lead to our door that night.<br><br>God has opened up my eyes, so I want to help open the eyes of others. I'm a firm believer that every time the gospel is preached, it bears fruit.
